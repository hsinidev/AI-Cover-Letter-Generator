The key is to use AI for inspiration, structure, and overcoming writer's block, but always infuse the final product with your own unique voice, experiences, and genuine enthusiasm. Think of it as a sophisticated grammar checker and brainstorming partner, not a replacement for your own effort and authenticity."

By providing the AI with the job description, it can strategically weave in relevant keywords and phrases that ATS software is designed to look for. This increases the likelihood of your application being seen by a human recruiter. However, the letter must still be well-written and coherent for the human reader."

First, provide the AI with specific details about your experiences, accomplishments, and skills (our tool has a 'Key Résumé Highlights' section for this). Second, select a tone that matches your personality. Finally, and most importantly, treat the AI-generated text as a first draft. Read it aloud, tweak phrases, add specific anecdotes, and ensure it reflects your genuine interest in the role and company."
